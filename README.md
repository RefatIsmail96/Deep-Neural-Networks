# Machine-Learning

This repository is one of my fun projects aimed at deepening my understanding of Machine Learning and gaining practical experience with Neural Networks. Specifically, I replicate the work introduced in the paper ([@Neural Ordinary Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07366.pdf)) where the authors levrage ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) to introduce a new family of deep Nueral Networks.

#Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Udacity for their valuable ([@tutorials](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch)) as well as their deep learning course. Their course material was very useful in helping me grasp the basic concepts of PyTorch and the different architectures of Nueral Networks.
